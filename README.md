# GSOC 2017: Face Alignment Module for OpenCV version 3.2.x
The project aims to implement state of the art Face alignment Technique proposed by Vahid Kazemi

## Project Description
The GSOC proposal can be found on [Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10LIfoV-pRIjoH-xNmLwaQOANavfMYT-5cS-4FpwTSPE).
We aim to implement the paper [One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d78b/6a5b0dcaa81b1faea5fb0000045a62513567.pdf)

## Mentor
I am being mentored by [Simon Niklaus](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjLtZSM-bPUAhXIgI8KHXKwCuoQFggqMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sniklaus.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNFbkMT3hq7F2D-SSMwDmVMIkBXZAg&sig2=wHJv3K7Zb5IvDuFeGWY7yg) from Portland State University.
